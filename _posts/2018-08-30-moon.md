The Moon is a satellite of Earth. The gravitational attraction of the two causes a tide on Earth.

The gravitational pull of Earth has led to tidal locking which means it always presents the same face to the planet.

Different faces are illuminated by the sun. Due to the tide, the rate the Moon recedes from Earth changes, lengthening the Earth's day.
