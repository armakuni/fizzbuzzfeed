The Moon is a satellite of Earth. The gravitational attraction of the two causes a tide on Earth.

The gravitational pull of the Earth has led to tidal locking which means it always presents the same face to the planet.

As the moon orbits, different faces are illuminated by the sun. Due to the tide, the rate at which the Moon recedes from the Earth changes over millions of years, lengthening the Earth's day.
